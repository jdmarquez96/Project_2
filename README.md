# Project_2


To work Project2.py, all you have to do is run the code from the command line. (i.e python3 Project2.py) The values that are interchangable are Nmeas, Nexp, and detector. To change these values, open up Project2.py through a text editor and manuelly change the three variables. Save the changes, then run the code to see the results. note that inputting large numbers will take some time.
